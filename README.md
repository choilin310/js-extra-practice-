# Javascript Extra Practice

## STEP 1: Fork the repository

## STEP 2: Clone the repositroy (using ssh)

## STEP 3: Install Dependencies

### Once you have the repository properly cloned to your machine:

- Make sure you `cd js-extra-practice` to move into the project
- `npm install` to install the JEST package

## STEP 4: Work on the code and run tests!

The problems in this repository are designed to be worked on one at a time. For example if you are working on `first-sum.js`, when you think you have the correct answer, you are ready to run the test!

- To run individual tests simple type `npm run test <your-test-file>` to run the specific test
- If you have finished all the questions, you can simple run `npm run test` and the Jest testing suite will run all the tests!

## NOTE!

- `01-values-and-types` do not have written tests
- You will get errors! Errors are our friends and are there to help us!

## STEP 5: Add, Commit and Push

When you are done with the problems, you need push your local changes to Github!

To do this run the following in your terminal:

- `git add .`
  - this command adds your changes to the staging area
- `git commit -m 'some commit message'`
  - this command commits the staged files, and adds a helpful message to know what changes were made
- `git push`
  - this command pushes your local code to github

### You can now submit the Github repository link in the Project Submissions Form!
